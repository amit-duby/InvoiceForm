            <p className="mt-2">Are you struggling with invoice rejections? </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              If yes, then let me tell you that you are not alone. It happens to
              the best of us. The chances of getting your invoices rejected
              increase if your invoice is not accurate. Therefore, it is
              essential to avoid some common invoicing mistakes.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Firstly, you should always add the{" "}
              <strong>invoice date while creating an invoice</strong>. It helps
              the client to identify the last payment date of the invoice.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Secondly, the{" "}
              <strong>invoice must have detailed information</strong> about the
              vendor or service provider and client details. You should include
              all the necessary information about the product or service
              offered.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Moreover,{" "}
              <strong>
                spelling mistakes can be a turn-off for your clients
              </strong>
              . Therefore, it is advisable to avoid any grammatical or spelling
              errors while creating an invoice. Keep the language simple, and
              avoid technical jargon or the short form of any word.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Last but not least, the <strong>incorrect total amount</strong>{" "}
              can be the most common cause of the rejection of the invoice.
              Therefore, you must ensure that the price and quantity agreed upon
              at the time of the agreement are accurate and the same as
              mentioned in the invoice. Furthermore, avoid adding the wrong tax
              rate to your invoice.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Remember, accuracy is the key to success when it comes to
              invoicing. So, don't hesitate to double-check your invoices before
              sending them to your clients.{" "}
