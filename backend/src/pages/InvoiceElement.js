              There are some elements that are extremely important when you
              create invoices online. One must add all these elements to the
              invoice. If any of these are missing, the chances of the invoice
              getting rejected will increase. So one should keep all these
              points when creating the invoice.

            <p className="mt-2">
              Every invoice should have a header section. It should be short and

              allows you to add the header. The invoice header should clearly
              convey the purpose of the invoice. In the invoice header, you can
              also add a company logo or personal logo.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You should also add the invoice number. The invoice number should
              be unique for every invoice you create. Having a unique invoice
              number can help you to track the invoice easily. The invoice
              number can be formatted in various ways. For example, 00001, or if
              you want to add a datewise invoice number then you can add
              2020/INV/001. You can do both on our free invoice maker, the
              system will take the next unique invoice number automatically.{" "}

            <p className="mt-2">
              After adding the invoice number, the next important element is the
              invoice date and due date. It helps the client to clear the
              confusion about when the invoice is received and the due date of
              the invoice payment.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              The next important element is the reference number, and it can be
              anything like a purchase order number or proforma invoice number,
              or quotation number via quotation maker. Having a reference number
              can easily know the details by referring to the previous
              documents.
