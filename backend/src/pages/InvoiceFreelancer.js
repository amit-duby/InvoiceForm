                Guide to create online invoice for freelancer
              </h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                It is always harder for freelancers to get paid once the service
                has been rendered. First, freelancers offer a service, and then
                an invoice is issued. Whereas, in other industries, the vendor
                charges the advance cost. And if you fail to collect payments
                then it becomes unbearable to run and manage a business.{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                In this process, invoicing setup is one of the important parts
                to collect payment faster. Here is a quick and simple guide to
                creating <strong>invoices for freelancers</strong> or service
                providers. You can also use our{" "}

                A quick overview of what your invoice should look like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li className="mt-2">

                </li>
                <li className="mt-2">
                  <p>Payment terms.</p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-3">
                <strong>1. Setup invoicing terms</strong>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Every project you take has different terms and conditions or
                requirements. So, it is essential to build and send a
                personalized invoice agreement to your clients. For instance,
                some of the service policies will change like due date, price,
                and discount. It is always important to issue an invoice as per
                the client invoicing process, this helps you get paid faster.{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                In short, there should be terms and policies agreed upon and
                signed by both parties. Here, the best document to create is a
                quotation using{" "}
                <a href="https://www.refrens.com/free-quotation-software">
                  <strong>quotation software</strong>
                </a>
                , which gives the client an idea of how much should pay once the
                work has been completed.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                <strong>
                  2. Make your invoice short, clear, and error free
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                When generating an invoice, be specific to the service you are
                offering to your client. More importantly, your invoice must be
                error-free. Error in the invoice can easily lead to its
                rejection.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, using technical jargon in the invoice is not
                recommended especially when the invoice will go in multiple
                hands before getting accepted. Each invoice should be
                understandable and should have a short and simple description.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                <strong>3. Payment policy terms</strong>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                It is a good practice to <strong>send invoices</strong> at a
                scheduled time. Having a payment policy term is good to get paid
                faster. If it is a recurring client, then select a specific day
                and time to send invoices. If you have a one-time project or
                regular project then outlining the payment process at the
                beginning of the project makes it much easier to collect a
                payment, and then follow up throughout the project. It gives
                your client an idea about when to expect the invoice and what
                type of expenses can incur.{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>4. Offer multiple payment options</strong>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                It would be best if you are feasible in accepting different
                payment options. Just because you don’t provide enough payment
                options to your client, is a good reason to hold on to your
                invoice and delay your payment. But it doesn’t mean using
                multiple payment gateways for a single payment.{" "}

                and small businesses by allowing users to connect their personal
                and work email accounts or integrate with Gmail. This
                integration serves a crucial function, especially when sending
                invoices, quotations, or any other communications to clients. By
                connecting your email accounts with Refrens, you can send emails
                directly from your own email address, creating a professional
                and personalized experience for your clients.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                For example - Imagine you have a primary email address like
                john.doe@gmail.com. When you connect this email with Refrens,
                any emails sent through the platform will appear to be sent from

                communication, and clients interact directly with your familiar
                email address. It not only adds a personal touch but also
                enhances the professionalism of your brand.

                or communications from clients will be directed straight to your
                designated email account. This eliminates the possibility of
                confusion or concerns about messages being sent to the invoicing
                software company rather than reaching you. It streamlines
                communication channels, contributing to a smoother and more
                transparent client experience.

                In essence, Refrens' email integration feature offers a
                convenient way to maintain a professional appearance while
                ensuring that your client interactions remain centralized and
                easily manageable from your own email account. This enhances
                client trust and helps in building lasting professional
                relationships.
