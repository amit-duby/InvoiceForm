              prices for their services, such as rent, bills, or subscriptions,

              the subscription ends.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>Credit Note</strong>: When clients return products for
              reasons like damage or mistakes, the supplier issues a credit
              note.

            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2">
              An invoice is typically issued by the seller or service provider
              to the buyer, outlining the details of the products or services
              sold, the quantity, the price per unit, and the total amount due

            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              On the other hand, a receipt is a document issued by the seller or
              service provider to the buyer after the payment has been made. It
              confirms that the payment has been received and outlines the
              details of the transaction, including the date, the amount paid,
              and the products or services purchased. A receipt is often used as
              proof of purchase or as a record for accounting purposes.

            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2">
              The supplier or the seller of the goods or services is responsible
              for issuing an invoice to their customers. The invoice serves as a
              legal document that facilitates payment and acts as proof of the
              transaction between the buyer and seller.

              What is the difference between an invoice and a bill?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Actually, there are some subtle differences between an invoice and
              a bill. While they both request payment for goods or services
              rendered, an invoice is typically issued before payment is made,
              while a bill is typically issued after payment is due or past due.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              In other words, an invoice is a document that is sent to a
              customer prior to payment being made, while a bill is a document
              that is sent to a customer after payment is due or past due.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Another difference is that an invoice usually contains more
              detailed information about the goods or services provided, while a
              bill may be more of a summary of what is owed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              In practice, the terms "invoice" and "bill" are often used
              interchangeably, and the specific usage may vary depending on the
              industry or region.
